## Performance Summary

| Graph Size | Vertices | Edges | Prim Faster | Kruskal Faster | MST Match |
|------------|----------|-------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Small      | 4-6      | 5-9   | Yes         | No             | ✓         |
| Medium     | 10-15    | 14-21 | Yes         | No             | ✓         |
| Large      | 20       | 28    | Yes         | No             | ✓         |

## Key Observations

1. **Correctness**: All graphs produce identical MST costs with both algorithms ✓
2. **Performance**: Prim's algorithm consistently performs fewer operations
3. **Complexity**: Both algorithms scale well with graph size
4. **Reliability**: 100% match rate across all test cases
